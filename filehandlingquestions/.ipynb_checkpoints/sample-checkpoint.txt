Counter It was 7 minutes after midnight.
The dog was lying on the grass in the middle of the lawn in front of Mrs Shearsâ€™ house.
Its eyes were closed. 
It looked as if it was running on its side, the way dogs run when they think they are chasing a cat in a dream. 
But the dog was not running or asleep. 
The dog was dead. 
There was a garden fork sticking out of the dog. 
The points of the fork must have gone all the way through the dog and into the ground because the fork had not fallen over.
